\f0\fs40 \cf0 Work done:\
\

\b From September 19 to October 3\

\b0 Simulating with bivariate normal and bivariate t distributions. Plotting sample size against D statistic. Added: want several curves on same graph for different values of gamma = m / m+n \'85 where m is the size of the 1st sample and n size of the 2nd sample.\
\
\

\b From September 12 to 19\

\b0 Getting big (2000) samples of pvalues (K.stat) for sample sizes of (5,5), (10,10), (15, 15), etc. and plotting along the D-Statistics. We want to know at what sample sizes the pvalues becomes U(0,1)\
\
Things that can change (ask Gilles...):\
distribution (other elliptical), scalars, different bi-variate sample size (for now, always matching), etc.\
\
Trouvaille:\
for MV standard normal, the sweet spot is (15,15)\
\

\b Beginning of term until September 12\

\b0 Getting the K statistics function worked out \'85\
(returning the K stat and the lvalues)\
